## E2E Testing with Jest and Puppeteer

Another great and short [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/end-to-end-testing-with-google-s-puppeteer-and-jest) course by [Tyler Clark](https://github.com/twclark0)  
This is the result of me following along with the course with some extra refactorings and personal additions.
